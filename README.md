# SQL
Customer Segmentation and Analysis using SQL.

I used SQL queries to extract insights about customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and more.

Dataset contains information about customers, products, transactions, and dates. I've used SQL queries to explore the dataset, data types, and basic statistics in order to segment customers into "loyal customers," "churning customers," etc. and analyze their purchase patterns, such as peak shopping times, average transaction values, and frequency of purchases. The result dataset was imported into Tableau to create visuals based on the SQL results.
